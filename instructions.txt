CS 3050: Systems Programming Lab — Multiprocessing vs Multithreading in C

Objectives:
- Understand the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading.
- Use fork() to create processes.
- Use pthread to create threads.
- Measure and compare performance.

Tasks:
1. multiprocessing.c: Create N child processes with fork(), compute and print a sum.
2. multithreading.c: Create N threads with pthread, compute and print a sum.
3. Compare performance using gettimeofday or clock_gettime.
4. Reflect on resource use, risks, and use cases.

Deliverables:
- multiprocessing.c
- multithreading.c
- performance.txt
- reflection.txt
