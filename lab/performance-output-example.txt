Multiprocessing: 0.120301
Multithreading:  0.089234

N = 4
-------------
Multiprocessing: 0.218742
Multithreading:  0.102877

N = 8
-------------
Multiprocessing: 0.401528
Multithreading:  0.113642

Observations:
- Multithreading is generally faster for this CPU-bound task due to lower overhead.
- Forking processes is heavier and scales less efficiently for larger N values.
